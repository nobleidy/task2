        Take the mobile technology for example. The faster the world is moving, the more hi-end the features are offered. Laptop gets thinner and smaller. It becomes more compact every year and offers more capabilities and top performance. It should load a lot of stuffs in a more concise shape. That is the need. People should not take time to think of what should be brought over a sales presentation in the southern state since everything is already "filed" in the laptop. Also for telephone. The need to be able to communicate anytime, anywhere, has inspired scientists to create cellular phone. And it gets smaller and smaller. And then it has more features, more games, more entertainment, and now offered more professional like having a computer in the pocket. And then from costly, it goes cheaper and better and faster and become more reliable. 
        Our daily office work is also technology based. No longer do people use the pen and paper to complete their work. We maintain our health by going to the gyms. There are machines in the gym which help us reduce our weight and keep fit. The use of technology has made our life comfortable. We cannot think of a life sans technology. We get to keep a lot of information in a small device and use it when we like. Cars have also become better with the use of technology. Thus technology is undeniably an important of our life.
